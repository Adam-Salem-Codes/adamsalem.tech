              <li>&#x2022; I was kind of bored.</li>

                &#x2022; It's a fun project/way to better my knowledge of web

              Create-React-App is a utility that helps you create a new React
              project. <br /> It is very useful for getting React projects up
              and running quickly.

              <p className="mt-2 w-[65%]">
                For the contact form I had to learn a lot of new code. First, I
                learned how to make a backend with express.js second, I learned
                how to work with the google gmail API and reCAPTCHA to send
                emails and make sure my inbox doesn't get spammed. Then I had to
                learn how to deploy frontend and backend at the same time and
                have them communicate JSON data. I also had to make the contact
                form look pretty.

                After I was done with most of the code it was time to test.
                Before this point I had not deployed this particular project
                before. Some people may ask: "What's Hop"; and "Why Hop?". Hop;
                specifically Ignite let's you login with GitHub and deploy your
                app. Whenever you make a commit it rebuilds. Why Hop? Hop is
                free forever (inbound traffic), Hop is very easy to work with
                and whenever I did run into a bug (It's in private beta
                currently) The employees at Hop helped me out in a timely
                manner. Thanks Rob#0642, cody#0004, Dustin#1999, pxseu#3020.

              This concludes my first blog post. They will probably get better
              over time (This is my first one) especially since this one was
              kind of rushed.
